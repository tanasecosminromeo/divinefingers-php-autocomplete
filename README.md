# divinefingers-php-autocomplete

Fork after https://github.com/Peekmo/atom-autocomplete-php

# Why?

I work remote, I love working remote... I want to use my awesome server to process as much as possible + hell of a lot of other reasons. Nothing does what I want correctly, so gogo atom. Thanks to Peekmo and everybody who contribuided to this.

# Important

I will not update this project constantly. I will update it only when and if I need it. Once I feel it's stable I will put a proper documentation though :)
